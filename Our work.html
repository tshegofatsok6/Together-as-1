<h1>Our Work

    <p>1.
      We focus primarily on either creating from scratch or modifying an already existing house into a house that is suitable for our client according to their disability .
      If you need it we can build it 
      2.
      We host workshop programs in every community that we have clients in and other neighbourhoods ,teaching and informing them about disabilities so that we all have a basic understanding that disability is normal and that disabled people are also still able to do some of the things fully abled people can do.
      3.
      Engage in charity programs anually where we give away a house, library or recreational centre along with our partners.
